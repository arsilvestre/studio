## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to reflect connectivity and community. It is bright enough to stand out on the dark background.
- Background color: A dark desaturated blue (#263238) for a modern and sophisticated feel. Chosen for dark scheme.
- Accent color: An analogous light blue (#29B6F6), contrasting with the dark background for highlights and interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a geometric and modern feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain readability and a humanist touch.
- Use clean, outlined icons that align with the modern sans-serif typography and color scheme, ensuring they are intuitive and enhance user experience.
- Implement a responsive design with a clear content hierarchy, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices, especially focusing on mobile responsiveness for on-the-go access.
- Use subtle transition animations for a smooth and engaging user experience. For example, use a fade-in effect for content loading or a slide-in effect for navigation menus.
